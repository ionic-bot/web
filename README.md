# Setup
1. Copy/rename the `.env.example` file as `.env`
2. Fill the values. You will get a port for the API when you set up the bot, but configuring a domain for it is on your own hands. You can get the Discord invite URL from your dev portal.
3. Install the Node.js packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Build the website with `yarn build` or `npm run build`
5. Now you can find it in the `dist/` directory!

# Ionic Web
The website for the Ionic Discord bot. This includes the leaderboard.

# Setup
1. Copy/rename the `.env.example` file as `.env`
2. Fill the values. The API URL follows the http[s]//[domain].[tld]:[port] format, you will get a port when you set up the bot; but configuring a domain for it is on your own hands. You can get the Discord invite URL from your dev portal.
3. Install the Node.js packages with `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Build the website with `yarn build` or `npm run build`
5. Now you can find it in the dist/ directory!
